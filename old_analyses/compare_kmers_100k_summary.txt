COMPREHENSIVE K-MER SIZE COMPARISON (100,000 samples per database)
=======================================================================

This analysis simulates 1 sequencing error per k-mer and tests if the
mutated k-mer still uniquely identifies the correct database.

COMPARISON TABLE:
-----------------
K-mer Size | Mean Error Tolerance | CEN Error Tolerance | ARMS Error Tolerance
-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------
K=21       | 0.3%                | 0.6% (±0.2%)       | 0.002% (~0%)
K=25       | 0.3%                | 0.6% (±0.2%)       | 0.001% (~0%)
K=31       | 0.3%                | 0.5% (±0.2%)       | 0.001% (~0%)
K=35       | 0.2%                | 0.4% (±0.2%)       | 0.001% (~0%)
K=41       | 0.2%                | 0.4% (±0.2%)       | 0.001% (~0%)

KEY FINDINGS:
=============

1. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE between k-mer sizes!
   - All show ~0.2-0.3% overall error tolerance
   - Differences are marginal and not practically significant

2. CEN markers show higher error tolerance than ARMS:
   - CEN: 0.4-0.6% error-tolerant (due to repetitive nature)
   - ARMS: ~0% error-tolerant (unique sequences)

3. When errors occur, almost always "novel" (no match):
   - Low risk of FALSE POSITIVES ✓
   - But reads are LOST (not classified)

4. Longer k-mers have HIGHER error probability:
   - K=21: ~2.1% error rate per k-mer
   - K=31: ~3.1% error rate per k-mer (+48% higher!)
   - K=41: ~4.1% error rate per k-mer (+95% higher!)

PRACTICAL IMPACT:
=================

Expected read retention after sequencing errors (0.1% error rate):

K=21: ~97.9% of k-mers are error-free
K=31: ~96.9% of k-mers are error-free  (-1.0% more lost reads!)
K=41: ~95.9% of k-mers are error-free  (-2.0% more lost reads!)

With 1 million reads:
- K=21: 979,000 usable k-mers
- K=31: 969,000 usable k-mers (-10,000 reads vs K=21)
- K=41: 959,000 usable k-mers (-20,000 reads vs K=21)

FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
====================

✓ Use K=21 or K=25 for your cenhapmer markers

Reasons:
1. LOWER error probability per k-mer
2. MORE reads retained for classification
3. NO advantage to longer k-mers for error tolerance
4. Shorter k-mers already provide excellent specificity

The theoretical advantage of longer k-mers (better cross-database 
specificity) is completely negated by their practical disadvantage
(higher sequencing error probability and more reads lost).
