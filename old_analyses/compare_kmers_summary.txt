COMPARISON OF ERROR RESILIENCE ACROSS K-MER SIZES
=======================================================================

This analysis simulates 1 sequencing error per k-mer and tests if the
mutated k-mer still uniquely identifies the correct database.

KEY FINDING: All k-mer sizes show ~0% error tolerance!
This means: When a k-mer gets 1 sequencing error, it almost never
still uniquely maps to the correct database.

COMPARISON TABLE:
-----------------
K-mer Size | Mean Error Tolerance | Main Outcome
-----------|---------------------|----------------------------------
K=21       | 0.0%                | ~100% become novel (no match)
K=25       | 0.0%                | ~100% become novel (no match)
K=31       | 0.0%                | ~100% become novel (no match)
K=35       | 0.0%                | ~100% become novel (no match)
K=41       | 0.0%                | ~100% become novel (no match)

INTERPRETATION:
===============

1. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE between k-mer sizes for error tolerance!
   - All k-mer sizes are equally fragile to single-base errors
   - This is because your markers are UNIQUE k-mers

2. Longer k-mers (k=31, k=41) are actually WORSE in practice:
   - Higher probability of containing an error (longer sequence)
   - K=21: ~2.1% error rate per k-mer
   - K=31: ~3.1% error rate per k-mer  
   - K=41: ~4.1% error rate per k-mer

3. When error occurs, outcome is typically "novel":
   - Mutated k-mer doesn't match ANY database
   - This means the read is LOST, not misclassified
   - Low risk of FALSE POSITIVES (good!)
   - But higher LOSS of reads with longer k-mers

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
Use K=21 or K=25 for your markers:
✓ Lower error probability per k-mer
✓ More reads retained
✓ No advantage to longer k-mers for error tolerance
✓ Shorter k-mers still provide sufficient specificity

The theoretical advantage of longer k-mers (better specificity)
is negated by their practical disadvantage (higher error rate).
